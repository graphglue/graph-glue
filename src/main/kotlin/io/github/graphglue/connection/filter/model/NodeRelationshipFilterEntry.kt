 * match a filter
 * Automatically includes a condition which checks that the filter does not include any nodes which the
 * provided Permission (if provided) does not allow to access. This prevents information leakage using filters.
 * Without this, it would be possible to get information of related nodes by brute-forcing different filters
 * (e.g. getting one character of a name at a time by checking if the related node is still returned).

 * @param filter filter to filter the elements of the set
 * @param permission the current read permission, used to only consider nodes in filters which match the permission
