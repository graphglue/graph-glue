# Connections

GraphGlue uses connections both for queries generated using the `name` parameter of the `@DomainNode` annotation and `NodeSetProperty` [GraphGlue relationship properties](./modeling#graphglue-relationships).

The generated connections adhere mostly to the [GraphQL Cursor Connections Specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm), except:

:::warning

In contrast to the specification, providing both `first` and `last` is not supported

:::

## Schema

The genrated connections have the following schema:

```graphql
type Query {
    types(
        after: String,
        before: String,
        filter: TypeFilterInput,
        first: Int,
        last: Int,
        orderBy: TypeOrder
    ): TypeConnection
}

type TypeConnection {
    edges: [TypeEdge!]!
    nodes: [Type!]!
    pageInfo: PageInfo!
    totalCount: Int!
}

type TypeEdge {
    cursor: String!
    node: Type!
}

type PageInfo {
    endCursor: String
    hasNextPage: Boolean!
    hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
    startCursor: String
}

type Type implements Node {
    # ...
}

input TypeFilterInput {
    # ...
}

input TypeOrder {
    direction: OrderDirection = ASC
    field: TypeOrderField = ID
}

enum TypeOrderField {
    ID
    # ...
}

enum OrderDirection {
    ASC
    DESC
}
```

## Inputs

- `after`: cursor, only nodes after the cursor are returned.
- `before`: cursor, only nodes before the cursor are returned.
- `filter`: filters the returned nodes, for filter generation see [Filtering](./modeling#filtering).
- `first`: only the first `n` nodes are returned, must not be present if `last` is present.
- `last`: only the last `n` nodes are returned, must not be present if `first` is present.
- `orderBy`: allows specifiying the order of the returned nodes (including the direction). Defaults to order ascending by ID. If a field other than id is specified, the id is used to guarantee strict total order, as the field may not be unique. For order field generation, see [Ordering](./modeling#ordering)

:::info

If [GrarphQL permission checking](./authorization#graphql) has been set up, connections are automatically filtered to only include nodes where the specified `Permission` is granted.
This is done before `first` or `last` is applied, meaning it is not possible to extract information this way.

:::

## Outputs

- `edges`: all nodes, with their specific cursor
- `nodes`: all nodes
- `totalCount`: total count of nodes after filtering, but before pagination
- `pageInfo`: allows checking if there are nodes after/before, and get the cursor for the first/last node returned

:::caution

Cursors are ordering dependent and are meant to be used for pagination, they are not meant to be stored long-time.

:::

:::info

`totalCount` is only fetched if specified, as it is rather expensive to fetch.
