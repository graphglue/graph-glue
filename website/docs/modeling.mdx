# Modeling

:::info

As this library is based on GraphQL Kotlin and Spring Data Neo4j, the modeling is mostly a merge of their approaches.
Almost all of their features still work when using this library. For more information on their features, please have a look at
[GraphQL Kotlin](https://opensource.expediagroup.com/graphql-kotlin/docs/schema-generator/schema-generator-getting-started) and
[Spring Data Neo4j](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#mapping)

:::

## Overview

Consider the following example of a `Node`:

```kotlin
@DomainNode("trees")                                // (1)
@Authorization("READ")                              // (2)
class Tree(
    @OrderProperty @FilterProperty val age: Int,    // (3)
    internal val name: String                       // (4)
) : Node() {                                        // (5)
    
    @NodeRelationship("ROOT", Direction.OUTGOING)   // (6)
    @delegate:Transient
    val root by NodeProperty<Root>()
    
    @NodeRelationship("LEAF", Direction.OUTGOING)   // (7)
    @delegate:Transient
    val leafs by NodeSetProperty<Leaf>()
    
    fun ageInDays() = age * 365                     // (8)
}
```

1. Necessary annotation for all `Node` classes. If the `name` parameter is provided, a connection-like query with the name `name` is exposed.
1. Specifies the `READ` permission for this Node, for more info, see [Authorization](./authorization)
1. Property which is exposed in the GraaphQL schema. As it is annotated with both `@OrderProperty` and `@FilterProperty`, connections of type `Tree` can both be filtered and ordered by this property.
1. Internal property NOT exposed in the GraphQL schema.
1. Each class needs to extend `Node` in order to use any GraphGlue specific features.
1. An outgoing relation of type `Root`.
1. An outgoing relation of type `Set<Leaf>`. In the GraphQL schema, it is exposed as `LeafConnection`
1. Function exposed as field in the GraphQL schema.

## Class Definition

Each node class both has to be annotated with `@DomainNode` and extend `io.github.graphglue.model.Node`.
If any of those conditions is missing, GraphGlue-specific features might not work.

:::tip

This does not mean that you never should use classes which fullfill neighter of those criteries.
For example, a non-node class can be used as type for properties with a struct-like type: it is still persisted in the database as node, however, in the GraphQL schema, it does not implement `Node`, meaning it is not possible to retrieve it via the `node` query.

:::

The Node class also defines an id. In Kotlin, it is possible to access the id using the `rawId` String property. It is not possible to manually assign an id, as a id is automatically generated when the node is first saved. However, the generation can be customized by providing a bean with the name `io.github.graphglue.model.NODE_ID_GENERATOR_BEAN` and the type `IdGenerator<String>`. By default, a random UUID is generated. 

## Properties

Properties are both used to expose fields in the GraphQL schema, and save properties on the node in the database.
By default, both Spring Data Neo4j and GraphQL Kotlin use the name of the property as name, however, the name in the GraphQL schema can be changed by annotating it with `@GraphQLName("name")`, the name of the property in the database can be changed by annotating it with `@Property("name")`.

:::caution
Spring Data Neo4j and GraphQL Kotlin use different visibilities. While property backed by a field (this includes delegated properties) is saved in the database. GraphQL Kotlin only exposes `public` properties not annotated with `@GraphQLIgnore`
:::

The used type must both be supported by GraphQL Kotlin and Spring Data Neo4j, however, both libaries provide extension mechanisms which allow you to support additional types.

## Functions
Like properties, functions can be used to expose field in the GraphQL schema.

## Relationships

###  GraphGlue relationships

Declaration of one-sides of relationships
```kotlin
@NodeRelationship(label, direction)
@delegate:Transient
val propertyName by NodeProperty<NodeType>()
```

Declaration of many-sides of relationships
```kotlin
@NodeRelationship(label, direction)
@delegate:Transient
val propertyName by NodeSetProperty<NodeType>()
```

where `label` is a `String`, and direction is either `Direction.INCOMING` or `Direction.OUTGOING`.

:::caution

Make sure to use `org.springframework.data.annotation.Transient`.
Kotlin `Transient` does not work and will result in strange errors, as Spring Data Neo4j tries to persist the backing field of the delegated property.

:::

On save, all relationships are saved. Save cascades down added entities, but removed ones.
Example: If the one side has initially the value `node1`, which then is replaced with `node2`, when saving, `node2` is saved (as it was "added"), while `node1` is not.


### Spring Data Neo4j relationships

Declaration of one-sides of relationships
```kotlin
@Relationship(label, direction)
val propertyName: NodeType
```

Declaration of many-sides of relationships
```kotlin
@Relationship(label, direction)
val propertyName: List<NodeType>
```

For more information, see [Connecting nodes: @Relationship](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#mapping.annotations.relationship)

## Inheritance

Currently, only inheriting from abstract classes is supported.
Specifically, inheriting from `open`, non-`abstract` classes is only supported if it is marked with `@GraphQLIgnore`.
Inheriting from interfaces is possible, however non of the GraphGlue annotations (`@DomainNode`, `@Authorization`, `@AdditionalFilter`) is supported there, however, it can e.g. be used to share common `@GraphQLDescriptions`.

:::note

The `@DomainNode` annotation is not inherited and has to be present on all node types.

## Ordering & Filtering

:::info

For more information on how to use ordering and filtering in GraphQL, see [Connections](./connections)

:::

### Ordering

All nodes can be ordered by id.
Additionally, nodes of a specific type can also be ordered by all properties annotated with `@OrderProperty`. As those might not be unique, the `id` is used to create a strict total order.
By default, all data types which are [comparable in Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/operators/#cypher-ordering) are supported.

### Filtering

Filters are generated for specific node types.
These filters are generated by concatenating property-based filter fields and additional filter fields.
Then, for each type, a meta filter is created, which allows joining filters by and, or and not:
```graphql
input TypeNodeFilterInput {
    # filter fields
}

input TypeFilterInput {
    and: [TypeFilterInput!]
    or: [TypeFilterInput!]
    not: TypeFilterInput
    node: TypeNodeFilterInput
}
```
Exactly one of the specified fields has to be provided.

#### Filters for properties

Properties can be annotated with `@FilterProperty` to allow filtering by a specific property. By default, this is supported for properties with the following types:
- `String`
- `Int`
- `Double` (Float in GraphQL)
- `Boolean`
- `ID`
- `by NodeProperty<*>`
- `by NodeSetProperty<*>`

Input fields of filters are always optional. All the present fields are then joined by `&&`.  
The input fields of the filter depends on the type: For `Boolean` and `ID`, only `eq` and `in` are available.
For all comparable types (`Int`, `Double` and `String`), `lt`, `lte`, `gt` and `gte` are additionally available.
Finally, for `String`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `contains` and `matches` are also available.

For `NodeProperty<*>` backed properties, the meta filter for the specific type is used.
For `NodeSetProperty<*>` backed properties, the filter fields include  `all`, `some` and `none`, each can be set to a type specific meta filter.

It is possible to support additional property types, by providing Spring beans of type `TypeFilterDefinitionEntry`.
Here an example for the Kotlin `Float` type:
```kotlin
@Bean
fun floatFilter() =
    TypeFilterDefinitionEntry(Float::class.createType()) { name, property, parentNodeDefinition, _ ->
        FloatFilterDefinition(name, parentNodeDefinition.getNeo4jNameOfProperty(property))
    }
```

#### Additional filters

With the `AdditionalFilter("beanName")` annotation, property independent filters can be defined.
This can for instance be used to filter by Node type, or a complex condition.
A Spring bean with the specified name and type `FilterEntryDefinition` has to be provided.
